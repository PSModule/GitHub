        .SYNOPSIS
        Create a repository dispatch event

        .DESCRIPTION
        You can use this endpoint to trigger a webhook event called `repository_dispatch` when you want activity
        that happens outside of GitHub to trigger a GitHub Actions workflow or GitHub App webhook. You must configure
        your GitHub Actions workflow or GitHub App to run when the `repository_dispatch`
        event occurs. For an example `repository_dispatch` webhook payload, see
        "[RepositoryDispatchEvent](https://docs.github.com/webhooks/event-payloads/#repository_dispatch)."

        The `client_payload` parameter is available for any extra information that your workflow might need.
        This parameter is a JSON payload that will be passed on when the webhook event is dispatched. For example,
        the `client_payload` can include a message that a user would like to send using a GitHub Actions workflow.
        Or the `client_payload` can be used as a test to debug your workflow.

        This endpoint requires write access to the repository by providing either:

        - Personal access tokens with `repo` scope. For more information, see
        "[Creating a personal access token for the command line](https://docs.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line)"
        in the GitHub Help documentation.
        - GitHub Apps with both `metadata:read` and `contents:read&write` permissions.

        This input example shows how you can use the `client_payload` as a test to debug your workflow.

        .EXAMPLE
        $params = @{
            EventType = 'on-demand-test'
            ClientPayload = @{
                unit = false
                integration = true
            }
        }
        Start-GitHubRepositoryEvent @params

        Starts a repository event with the name `on-demand-test` and a `client_payload` that includes `unit` and `integration`.
