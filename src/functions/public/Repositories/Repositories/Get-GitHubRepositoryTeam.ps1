        .SYNOPSIS
        List repository teams

        .DESCRIPTION
        Lists the teams that have access to the specified repository and that are also visible to the authenticated user.

        For a public repository, a team is listed only if that team added the public repository explicitly.

        Personal access tokens require the following scopes:
        * `public_repo` to call this endpoint on a public repository
        * `repo` to call this endpoint on a private repository (this scope also includes public repositories)

        This endpoint is not compatible with fine-grained personal access tokens.

        .EXAMPLE
        Get-GitHubRepositoryTeam -Owner 'PSModule' -Name 'GitHub'

        Lists the teams that have access to the specified repository and that are also visible to the authenticated user.
