        .SYNOPSIS
        Disables workflow commands for a block of code.

        .DESCRIPTION
        DSL approach for GitHub Action commands.
        Allows for colapsing of code in IDE for code that belong together.

        .EXAMPLE
        Set-GitHubNoCommandGroup {
            Write-Host 'Hello, World!'
            Write-GithubError 'This is an error'
        }

        Groups commands where no workflow commands are run.

        .EXAMPLE
        NoLogGroup 'MyGroup' {
            Write-Host 'Hello, World!'
            Write-GithubError 'This is an error'
        }

        Groups commands where no workflow commands are run, using an alias and DSL approach.
