        .SYNOPSIS
        Masks a value in a log

        .DESCRIPTION
        Masking a value prevents a string or variable from being printed in the log. Each masked word separated by whitespace is
        replaced with the * character. You can use an environment variable or string for the mask's value. When you mask a value,
        it is treated as a secret and will be redacted on the runner. For example, after you mask a value, you won't be able to
        set that value as an output.

        .EXAMPLE
        Add-Mask $SecretValue

        Masks the value of $SecretValue so that its printed like ***.

        .EXAMPLE
        $SecretValue1, $SecretValue2 | Mask

        Masks the value of $SecretValue1 and $SecretValue2 so that its printed like ***, using the pipeline
