        .SYNOPSIS
        Stops workflow commands

        .DESCRIPTION
        Stops processing any workflow commands. This special command allows you to log anything without accidentally running a workflow command.
        For example, you could stop logging to output an entire script that has comments.

        To stop the processing of workflow commands, pass a unique string to the function. To resume processing workflow commands, pass the same string
        that you used to stop workflow commands to the Enable-GitHubCommand.

        .EXAMPLE
        Disable-GitHubCommand "123"

        Stops processing any workflow commands.
