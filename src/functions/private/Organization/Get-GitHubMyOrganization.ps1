        .SYNOPSIS
        List organizations for the authenticated user

        .DESCRIPTION
        List organizations for the authenticated user.

        **OAuth scope requirements**

        This only lists organizations that your authorization allows you to operate on
        in some way (e.g., you can list teams with `read:org` scope, you can publicize your
        organization membership with `user` scope, etc.). Therefore, this API requires at
        least `user` or `read:org` scope. OAuth requests with insufficient scope receive a
        `403 Forbidden` response.

        .EXAMPLE
        Get-GitHubMyOrganization

        List organizations for the authenticated user.
