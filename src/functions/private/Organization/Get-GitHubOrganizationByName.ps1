        .SYNOPSIS
        Get an organization

        .DESCRIPTION
        To see many of the organization response values, you need to be an authenticated organization
        owner with the `admin:org` scope. When the value of `two_factor_requirement_enabled` is `true`,
        the organization requires all members, billing managers, and outside collaborators to enable
        [two-factor authentication](https://docs.github.com/articles/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/).

        GitHub Apps with the `Organization plan` permission can use this endpoint to retrieve information
        about an organization's GitHub plan. See
        "[Authenticating with GitHub Apps](https://docs.github.com/apps/building-github-apps/authenticating-with-github-apps/)"
        for details. For an example response, see 'Response with GitHub plan information' below."

        .EXAMPLE
        Get-GitHubOrganizationByName -Organization 'github'

        Get the 'GitHub' organization
