        .SYNOPSIS
        List repositories for the authenticated user

        .DESCRIPTION
        Lists repositories that the authenticated user has explicit permission (`:read`, `:write`, or `:admin`) to access.
        The authenticated user has explicit permission to access repositories they own, repositories where
        they are a collaborator, and repositories that they can access through an organization membership.

        .EXAMPLE
        Get-GitHubMyRepositories

        Gets the repositories for the authenticated user.

        .EXAMPLE
        Get-GitHubMyRepositories -Visibility 'private'

        Gets the private repositories for the authenticated user.

        .EXAMPLE
        $param = @{
            Visibility = 'public'
            Affiliation = 'owner','collaborator'
            Sort = 'created'
            Direction = 'asc'
            PerPage = 100
            Since = (Get-Date).AddYears(-5)
            Before = (Get-Date).AddDays(-1)
        }
        Get-GitHubMyRepositories @param

        Gets the public repositories for the authenticated user that are owned by the authenticated user
        or that the authenticated user has been added to as a collaborator. The results are sorted by
        creation date in ascending order and the results are limited to 100 repositories. The results
        are limited to repositories created between 5 years ago and 1 day ago.

        .EXAMPLE
        Get-GitHubMyRepositories -Type 'forks'

        Gets the forked repositories for the authenticated user.

        .EXAMPLE
        Get-GitHubMyRepositories -Type 'sources'

        Gets the non-forked repositories for the authenticated user.

        .EXAMPLE
        Get-GitHubMyRepositories -Type 'member'

        Gets the repositories for the authenticated user that are owned by an organization.
