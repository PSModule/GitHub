        .SYNOPSIS
        Get a repository

        .DESCRIPTION
        The `parent` and `source` objects are present when the repository is a fork.
        `parent` is the repository this repository was forked from, `source` is the ultimate source for the network.
        **Note:** In order to see the `security_and_analysis` block for a repository you must have admin permissions
        for the repository or be an owner or security manager for the organization that owns the repository.
        For more information, see "[Managing security managers in your organization](https://docs.github.com/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/managing-security-managers-in-your-organization)."
