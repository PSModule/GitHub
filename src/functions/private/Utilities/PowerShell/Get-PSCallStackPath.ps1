function Get-PSCallStackPath {
    <#
        .SYNOPSIS
        Create a string representation of the current call stack.

        .DESCRIPTION
        This function creates a string representation of the current call stack.
        You can use the SkipFirst and SkipLatest parameters to skip the first and last.
        By default it will skip the first (what called the initial function, typically <ScriptBlock>),
        and the last (the current function, Get-PSCallStackPath).

        .EXAMPLE
        Get-PSCallStackPath
        First-Function\Second-Function\Third-Function

        Shows the call stack of the last function called, Third-Function, with the first (<ScriptBlock>)
        and last (Get-PSCallStackPath) functions removed.

        .EXAMPLE
        Get-PSCallStackPath -SkipFirst 0
        <ScriptBlock>\First-Function\Second-Function\Third-Function

        Shows the call stack of the last function called, Third-Function, with the first function included (typically <ScriptBlock>).

        .EXAMPLE
        Get-PSCallStackPath -SkipLatest 0
        First-Function\Second-Function\Third-Function\Get-PSCallStackPath

        Shows the call stack of the last function called, Third-Function, with the last function included (Get-PSCallStackPath).
