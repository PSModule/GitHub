        .SYNOPSIS
        Get a user

        .DESCRIPTION
        Provides publicly available information about someone with a GitHub account.
        GitHub Apps with the `Plan` user permission can use this endpoint to retrieve information about a user's GitHub plan.
        The GitHub App must be authenticated as a user. See
        "[Identifying and authorizing users for GitHub Apps](https://docs.github.com/apps/building-github-apps/identifying-and-authorizing-users-for-github-apps/)"
        for details about authentication. For an example response, see 'Response with GitHub plan information' below"
        The `email` key in the following response is the publicly visible email address from your GitHub
        [profile page](https://github.com/settings/profile). When setting up your profile, you can select a primary email
        address to be ΓÇ£publicΓÇ¥ which provides an email entry for this endpoint. If you do not set a public email address for `email`,
        then it will have a value of `null`. You only see publicly visible email addresses when authenticated with GitHub.
        For more information, see [Authentication](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#authentication).
        The Emails API enables you to list all of your email addresses, and toggle a primary email to be visible publicly.
        For more information, see "[Emails API](https://docs.github.com/rest/users/emails)".

        .EXAMPLE
