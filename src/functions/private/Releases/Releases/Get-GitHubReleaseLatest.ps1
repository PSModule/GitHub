        .SYNOPSIS
        Get the latest release

        .DESCRIPTION
        View the latest published full release for the repository.
        The latest release is the most recent non-prerelease, non-draft release, sorted by the `created_at` attribute.
        The `created_at` attribute is the date of the commit used for the release, and not the date when the release was drafted or published.

        .EXAMPLE
        Get-GitHubReleaseLatest -Owner 'octocat' -Repository 'hello-world'

        Gets the latest releases for the repository 'hello-world' owned by 'octocat'.
