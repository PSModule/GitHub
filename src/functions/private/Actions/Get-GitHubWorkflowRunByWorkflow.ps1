        .SYNOPSIS
        List workflow runs for a workflow

        .DESCRIPTION
        List all workflow runs for a workflow. You can replace `workflow_id` with the workflow filename. For example, you could use `main.yaml`.
        You can use parameters to narrow the list of results. For more information about using parameters, see
        [Parameters](https://docs.github.com/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#parameters).
        Anyone with read access to the repository can use this endpoint
        OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` scope to use this endpoint with a private repository.
        This endpoint will return up to 1,000 results for each search when using the following parameters: `actor`, `branch`, `check_suite_id`,
        `created`, `event`, `head_sha`, `status`.

        .EXAMPLE
        Get-GitHubWorkflowRunByWorkflow -Owner 'octocat' -Repository 'Hello-World' -ID '42'

        Gets all workflow runs for the workflow with the ID `42` in the repository `Hello-World` owned by `octocat`.

        .EXAMPLE
        Get-GitHubWorkflowRunByWorkflow -Owner 'octocat' -Repository 'Hello-World' -ID '42' -Actor 'octocat' -Branch 'main' -Event 'push' -Status 'success'

        Gets all workflow runs for the workflow with the ID `42` in the repository `Hello-World` owned by `octocat` that were triggered by the user
        `octocat` on the branch `main` and have the status `success`.
