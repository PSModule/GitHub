        .SYNOPSIS
        List repository teams.

        .DESCRIPTION
        Lists the teams that have access to the specified repository and that are also visible to the authenticated user.
        For a public repository, a team is listed only if that team added the public repository explicitly.
        OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the public_repo or repo scope to use this endpoint with a public repository,
        and repo scope to use this endpoint with a private repository.

        .EXAMPLE
        Get-GitHubTeamListByRepo -Owner 'octocat' -Repository 'Hello-World'

        Output:
        ```powershell

        ```

        Lists all teams that have access to the 'Hello-World' repository owned by 'octocat'.

        .OUTPUTS
        GitHubTeam[]
