TOPIC
    about_Auth

SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Describes the authentication methods provided in the PowerShell module for interacting with GitHub's REST API.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    This module provides several functions to manage authentication for GitHub's REST API. There are primarily two ways to authenticate:

    1. GitHub Device Flow: This method involves a user being prompted to visit a specific URL on GitHub and enter a code that's provided by the module. Once the user enters the code on the GitHub website, the module retrieves the necessary access tokens to make authenticated API requests.

    2. Personal Access Token: The user can also provide a Personal Access Token (PAT) to authenticate. This PAT gives the module the ability to interact with the API on behalf of the user.

    The module also provides a way to refresh the access token and to disconnect or logout from the GitHub account.

EXAMPLES
    Example 1:
        Connect-GitHubAccount -AccessToken 'ghp_####'
        Connects to GitHub using a personal access token (PAT).

    Example 3:
        Disconnect-GitHubAccount
        Disconnects from GitHub and removes the current GitHub configuration.
